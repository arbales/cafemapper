#CafeMapper
CafeMapper is/will-be a simple localStorge ORM at base. 

- Thin object wrapper for localStorage
- Loose revision tracking for objects
- Sync via JSON to server datasource discretely or as a set. 
- Feels comfortable with your server-side DataMapper.
- [dominoes](http://github.com/jaubourg/dominoes/) for Javascript loading/scheduling.

CafeMapper is being rewritten from existing (poorer) code. I'm by no means an expert, so feedback/corrections/issues are welcome.
